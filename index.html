    <h1>What is programming?</h1>

    <p class="header-p"><q>Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to build bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning.</q></p>

  <section>
    <p>Programming is the art of solving problems with software. It is not about learning a language to communicate instructions to a computer. Instead, it is the art of thinking about a real problem, cutting it into small parts, designing a solution for each small part, joining all the solutions into a larger algorithm, and then choosing the most appropriate programming language to code this algorithm for that a computer executes it.</p>

    <p>Code is easy! Thinking about a problem, identifying if this problem or a part of this problem can be solved with software, and start to thinking the solution is the more important and harder part of programming.</p>

    <p>So, we can conclude that a programmer should be a problem solver! Are you?</p>
